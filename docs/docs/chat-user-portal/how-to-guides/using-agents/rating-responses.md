# Rating Agent Responses

Provide feedback on agent responses to help improve quality and inform administrators.

## Why Rate Responses?

Your ratings help:

- **Improve agent quality**: Administrators use feedback to refine agent configurations
- **Track performance**: Organizations can monitor how well agents are meeting user needs
- **Identify issues**: Low ratings highlight problems that need attention
- **Guide development**: Feedback influences future agent improvements

## When Rating Is Available

The rating feature appears when:
- Your administrator has enabled message rating
- The agent is configured to allow ratings
- The agent's response has finished generating

Look for the **Rate Message** button in the footer of agent responses.

## How to Rate a Response

### Step 1: Find the Rate Button

1. Look at the bottom of an agent's response message
2. Find the **Rate Message** button (shows a thumbs-up icon 👍)
3. The icon changes based on any existing rating:
   - Outline icon: Not yet rated
   - Filled thumbs-up: You liked this response
   - Filled thumbs-down: You disliked this response

### Step 2: Open the Rating Dialog

1. Click **Rate Message**
2. A dialog opens with rating options

### Step 3: Choose Your Rating

In the rating dialog:

| Button | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Like** (thumbs up) | The response was helpful, accurate, and useful |
| **Dislike** (thumbs down) | The response had issues, was unhelpful, or incorrect |

Click a button to select your rating:
- The button fills in to show your selection
- Click the same button again to remove your rating
- You can change your mind before submitting

### Step 4: Add Comments (Optional)

The **Comments** field lets you explain your rating:

**For positive ratings, you might note:**
- What made the response particularly helpful
- How the agent exceeded expectations
- Specific aspects that worked well

**For negative ratings, consider explaining:**
- What was incorrect or misleading
- What information was missing
- How the response could have been better
- What you expected instead

### Step 5: Submit Your Rating

1. Click **Submit** to save your rating
2. A confirmation message appears: "Rating submitted!"
3. The dialog closes automatically

## Rating Indicators

After rating, the response shows your feedback:

| Icon State | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 👍 (filled) | You liked this response |
| 👎 (filled) | You disliked this response |
| 👍 (outline) | Not rated, or rating cleared |

## Changing Your Rating

You can update a rating at any time:

1. Click **Rate Message** on the response
2. Select a different rating option
3. Update your comments if desired
4. Click **Submit**

Your new rating replaces the previous one.

## Clearing a Rating

To remove your rating entirely:

1. Click **Rate Message**
2. Click your current rating (Like or Dislike) to deselect it
3. Clear the comments field if desired
4. Click **Submit**

## What Makes a Good Rating?

### When to Give a Positive Rating (👍)

- The response directly answered your question
- Information was accurate and complete
- The format was easy to read and use
- The agent understood your intent correctly
- The response saved you time or effort

### When to Give a Negative Rating (👎)

- The response was factually incorrect
- The agent misunderstood your question
- Important information was missing
- The response was confusing or poorly formatted
- The agent gave generic content instead of specific help

### Writing Helpful Comments

**Good comments are specific:**

Instead of: "Bad response"
Try: "The sales figures for Q3 were incorrect — actual revenue was $2.1M not $1.8M"

Instead of: "Great!"  
Try: "The step-by-step format made it easy to follow the instructions"

## When Rating Isn't Available

You won't see the rating option if:

- **Feature disabled**: Your administrator hasn't enabled ratings
- **Agent configuration**: The specific agent doesn't support ratings
- **Message still loading**: Wait for the response to complete
- **User messages**: Only agent responses can be rated

## Privacy and Visibility

Your ratings:

- Are associated with your user account
- Are visible to administrators and system managers
- May be used to improve agent performance
- Help identify patterns across users

> **Note:** Comments should be professional and focused on the response quality. Avoid including sensitive personal information in rating comments.

## Best Practices

### Rate Consistently

- Apply the same standards across similar responses
- Don't let one bad experience color ratings of unrelated responses
- Rate based on the specific response, not the agent overall

### Provide Constructive Feedback

- Focus on how the response could improve
- Be specific about what was wrong or right
- Suggest what a better response would include

### Rate Important Responses

- You don't need to rate every message
- Focus on responses that were notably helpful or problematic
- Your feedback is most valuable for responses you have expertise to evaluate

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Button Not Visible

- The feature may not be enabled — contact your administrator
- Wait for the response to finish generating
- Check if you're looking at an agent response (not your own message)

### Rating Won't Submit

- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page and rating again
- Ensure you've selected either Like or Dislike

### Comments Not Saving

- Comments are saved with the rating submission
- Make sure you clicked **Submit** after adding comments
- Very long comments may be truncated

### Wrong Rating Submitted

- Click **Rate Message** to open the dialog again
- Select the correct rating
- Click **Submit** to update
