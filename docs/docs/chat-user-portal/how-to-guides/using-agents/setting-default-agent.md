# Setting a Default Agent

Learn how to set a default agent that's automatically selected for new conversations.

## Overview

The default agent is the AI assistant that's automatically selected when you start a new conversation. Setting a default agent saves time if you primarily use one agent for your work.

## How Default Agents Work

### System Default vs. Personal Default

| Type | Set By | Applies To |
|------|--------|------------|
| **System Default** | Administrators | All users (unless they choose differently) |
| **Personal Default** | You | Only your account |

### Precedence

1. Your personal default (if set) takes priority
2. Otherwise, the system default is used
3. If no defaults are set, the first available agent is selected

## Setting Your Default Agent

### From Settings

1. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar
2. Click the **Agents** tab
3. Find the agent you want as your default
4. Click the **Set as Default** option (if available)
5. A confirmation appears

### Visual Indicators

- The current default agent shows a **Default** badge or star icon
- When you change the default, the badge moves to the new selection

## Who Can Set Defaults

### Personal Default

Most users can set their own default agent from the agents they have access to.

### System Default (Organization-Wide)

Setting the system-wide default requires:

- Access to the Management Portal
- The **User Access Administrator** role
- Navigate to **All Agents** and use the **Set Default** action

## When the Default Agent is Used

The default agent is automatically selected when:

- You open the User Portal for a new session
- You create a new conversation
- You don't explicitly select a different agent

The default agent is **not** used when:

- You switch agents during a conversation (the new agent becomes active)
- You select a different agent from the dropdown
- You return to an existing conversation (which uses its original agent)

## Changing the Default Agent

### Switching Your Default

1. Go to **Settings** > **Agents**
2. Find the new agent you want as default
3. Click **Set as Default**
4. The previous default is cleared automatically

### Clearing the Default

To stop having a personal default:

> **Note:** Some configurations may not allow clearing the default. In this case, simply choose a different agent as your default.

## Best Practices

### Choosing a Good Default

| Use Case | Recommended Default |
|----------|---------------------|
| General office work | A versatile, general-purpose agent |
| Specialized role | An agent matching your primary job function |
| Frequent task | The agent you use most often |

### When Not to Use Default

Consider not relying heavily on the default if:

- You frequently need different agents for different tasks
- Your work varies significantly day-to-day
- You're evaluating multiple agents

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Set Default

- Verify you have access to the agent
- Check if your organization allows personal defaults
- The agent may need to be enabled first

### Default Not Being Used

- Clear your browser cache
- Check if you have a conversation already open with a different agent
- Verify the agent is still active and available

### Default Changed Unexpectedly

- An administrator may have changed the system default
- The previous default agent may have been disabled or deleted
- Check your Settings to confirm your current default
