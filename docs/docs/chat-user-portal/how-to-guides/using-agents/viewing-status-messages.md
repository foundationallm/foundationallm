## Understanding Message Content

### What Messages Include

Good status messages typically contain:

- **Title**: Brief summary of the situation
- **Description**: Details about what's happening
- **Timing**: When it started, expected duration or resolution
- **Impact**: What services are affected
- **Actions**: What you should do (if anything)

### Example Messages

**Planned Maintenance:**
> "Scheduled Maintenance - Saturday 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM ET. The system will be unavailable during this time."

**Active Issue:**
> "Service Degradation - Some users may experience slow responses. Our team is investigating."

**Resolution:**
> "Resolved - The file upload issue reported earlier has been fixed. Normal service is restored."

## What to Do During Outages

### When the System is Unavailable

1. **Don't panic** — IT is likely already aware and working on it
2. **Check the status message** for expected resolution time
3. **Save any work** in other applications if possible
4. **Wait** until the maintenance window ends
5. **Contact support** only if issues persist past the stated time
