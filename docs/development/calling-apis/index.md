# Directly calling APIs

Although FoundationaLLM provides user interfaces for most of the operations, you can also call the APIs directly. This is useful when you want to automate some operations or when you want to integrate FoundationaLLM with other systems.

The links below provide the documentation for calling the Core and Management APIs, respectively:

- [Core API](./directly-calling-core-api.md)
- [Management API](./directly-calling-management-api.md)
