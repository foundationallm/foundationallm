# Printing Conversations

Create a printed copy or PDF of your conversation with an AI agent.

## How to Print a Conversation

1. Open the conversation you want to print
2. Look in the **top navigation bar**, to the right of the agent selector dropdown
3. Click the **Print button** (it looks like a printer icon 🖨️)
4. Your browser's print dialog will open
5. Choose your printer or select **Save as PDF**
6. Click **Print** or **Save**

> **Tip:** The print button only appears when you have a conversation open. If you don't see it, make sure you've selected a chat session from the sidebar.

## What Gets Printed

When you print a conversation, the output includes:

✅ **Included in printout:**
- All your messages (questions and prompts)
- All agent responses
- Message formatting (bold, italics, headers, lists)
- Tables
- Code blocks (with syntax highlighting colors preserved)
- Mathematical equations and formulas
- Timestamps showing when each message was sent

❌ **Not included in printout:**
- Navigation sidebar
- Agent selector dropdown
- Chat input box
- Copy, Rate, and View Prompt buttons
- File upload areas
- Any attached files (these need to be downloaded separately)

## Saving as PDF

Instead of printing to paper, you can save your conversation as a PDF file:

1. Click the **Print button** in the navigation bar
2. In the print dialog, look for the printer/destination selection
3. Choose **Save as PDF**, **Microsoft Print to PDF**, or similar option
4. Click **Save** or **Print**
5. Choose where to save the PDF file on your computer
6. Click **Save**

### Where to Find "Save as PDF"

The option location varies by browser:

| Browser | Where to Find It |
|---------|------------------|
| **Chrome** | Destination dropdown → Select "Save as PDF" |
| **Edge** | Printer dropdown → Select "Microsoft Print to PDF" or "Save as PDF" |
| **Firefox** | Destination dropdown → Select "Save to PDF" |
| **Safari** | PDF dropdown (bottom-left) → Select "Save as PDF" |

## Print Settings

Before printing, you can adjust settings in your browser's print dialog:

### Page Layout
- **Portrait** (default): Best for most conversations
- **Landscape**: Useful if your conversation has wide tables or code blocks

### Margins
- **Default/Normal**: Recommended for most printouts
- **Minimum/None**: Fits more content per page but may cut off edges

### Scale
- **100%** (default): Normal size
- **Fit to page**: Shrinks content if needed to fit the page width
- **Custom**: Adjust percentage manually

### Background Graphics
- **Enable this option** to preserve message colors and code block backgrounds
- Usually labeled "Background graphics" or "Print backgrounds"

> **Important:** Enable "Background graphics" or "Print background colors" to keep the visual distinction between your messages and agent responses.

## Tips for Better Printouts

### Before Printing

1. **Scroll through the entire conversation** first to ensure all messages have fully loaded
2. **Long conversations** will span multiple pages automatically
3. **Code blocks** print better in landscape orientation if they're wide

### Choosing Paper Size

- **Letter (8.5" × 11")** or **A4**: Standard choice for most printouts
- Larger paper sizes work well for conversations with wide tables or code

### For Professional Documents

If you're printing for a report or documentation:
1. Save as PDF first
2. Open the PDF and verify it looks correct
3. Print from the PDF for consistent results

## Troubleshooting

### Print Button Not Visible

- Make sure you have a conversation open (not just the welcome screen)
- The button appears next to the agent dropdown in the top navigation bar
- Try refreshing the page if buttons aren't loading

### Colors Not Printing

1. In the print dialog, look for **Background graphics** or **Print backgrounds**
2. Make sure this option is **enabled/checked**
3. Some printers default to black and white—check your printer settings

### Content Getting Cut Off

- Try **Landscape** orientation for wide content
- Reduce the **Scale** to 90% or 80%
- Use **Minimum margins** if available
- For code blocks, consider copying the code separately instead

### Pages Are Blank or Missing Content

- Wait for the conversation to fully load before printing
- Scroll through the conversation to trigger loading of all messages
- Try refreshing the page and printing again
- Check if your browser is blocking pop-ups (the print dialog is a pop-up)

### Mathematical Equations Look Wrong

Mathematical formulas should print correctly. If they appear broken:
- Try using Chrome or Edge for better equation rendering
- Save as PDF first, then print from the PDF

### Print Dialog Doesn't Open

- Check if your browser is blocking pop-ups for this site
- Try the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl + P` (Windows) or `Cmd + P` (Mac)
- Make sure you clicked the print button and not another icon

## Keyboard Shortcut

You can also use your browser's built-in print shortcut:

| Operating System | Shortcut |
|------------------|----------|
| Windows | `Ctrl + P` |
| Mac | `Cmd + P` |

This opens the same print dialog as clicking the print button.

## Alternatives to Printing

If printing doesn't meet your needs, consider these options:

| Need | Alternative |
|------|-------------|
| Share specific responses | Use the **Copy** button on individual messages |
| Save for later reference | Save as **PDF** instead of printing |
| Include in a document | Copy messages and paste into Word or Google Docs |
| Archive conversations | Your conversations are automatically saved in the sidebar |
