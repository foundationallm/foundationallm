# Monitoring Token Consumption

Learn how to track token usage during your conversations.

## Overview

Token consumption tracking helps you understand the resource usage of your AI interactions.

## What are Tokens?

- Tokens are units of text processed by the AI model
- One token is roughly 4 characters in English
- Both input (your prompts) and output (responses) consume tokens

## Viewing Token Usage

If enabled by the agent:
1. Look for token counters in the conversation interface
2. View consumption for individual messages
3. Track cumulative usage for the session

## Token Display

The interface may show:
- **Prompt tokens**: Tokens used in your input
- **Completion tokens**: Tokens used in the response
- **Total tokens**: Combined usage

## Managing Token Usage

To optimize token consumption:
- Be concise in your prompts
- Avoid unnecessary context repetition
- Use conversation history effectively
