# Using the Knowledge Tool

Learn how to leverage the Knowledge Tool for searching and retrieving information.

## Overview

The Knowledge Tool enables agents to:
- Search through uploaded files and documents
- Retrieve relevant information from knowledge bases
- Provide context-aware responses based on your data

## How It Works

1. **Upload files** to the conversation (if needed)
2. **Ask questions** about your content
3. **Agent searches** the knowledge base
4. **Relevant information** is retrieved and used in the response

## Knowledge Sources

The Knowledge Tool can search:
- Files uploaded to the current conversation
- Pre-configured knowledge bases
- Connected data sources

## Example Use Cases

### Document Q&A
