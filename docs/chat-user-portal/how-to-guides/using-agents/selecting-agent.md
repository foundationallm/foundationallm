# Selecting an Agent

Choose the right AI agent for your task from the available options.

## Understanding Agents

Agents are AI assistants configured for specific purposes. Different agents may:

- Have access to different knowledge bases or data sources
- Be optimized for particular types of tasks
- Use different AI models or capabilities
- Have unique tools like code execution or image generation

Selecting the right agent ensures you get the best possible responses for your needs.

## The Agent Selector

The agent selector is a dropdown menu located in the **top navigation bar**, to the right of the current conversation name.

### What You'll See

- **Agent icon**: An icon representing the current agent
- **Dropdown menu**: Shows the currently selected agent's name
- **Agent groups**: Agents are organized into categories

## Selecting an Agent

### Step 1: Open the Dropdown

1. Look in the top-right area of the navigation bar
2. Click the **agent dropdown** (shows the current agent's name)
3. The dropdown expands to show available agents

### Step 2: Browse Available Agents

Agents are organized into groups:

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Featured** | Highlighted agents recommended by your organization |
| **Other** | Additional agents you have access to |

### Step 3: Choose an Agent

1. Review the agent names in the dropdown
2. Click on the agent you want to use
3. A confirmation message appears: "Agent changed to [agent name]"

## What Happens When You Switch Agents

When you select a different agent during an active conversation:

1. **A new conversation starts** — This ensures the new agent isn't confused by context from the previous agent
2. **Your previous conversation is preserved** — It remains in the sidebar and you can return to it
3. **The new agent's welcome message appears** — Introducing what the new agent can help with

> **Note:** Switching agents always creates a new conversation to maintain clean context for each agent.

## Agent Information

### Welcome Messages

When you start a conversation with an agent, you may see a welcome message explaining:
- What the agent specializes in
- Types of questions it can answer
- How to get the best results

### Identifying the Current Agent

The current agent is shown:
- In the dropdown display in the navigation bar
- Next to each agent response in the conversation (with an agent icon)

## Featured vs. Other Agents

### Featured Agents

Featured agents are highlighted by your organization because they:
- Are commonly used or recommended
- Are particularly well-suited for common tasks
- Have been recently added or updated

Featured agents appear at the top of the dropdown in their own section.

### Other Agents

The "Other" section contains:
- Agents not designated as featured
- Specialized agents for less common tasks
- Agents you've enabled but aren't featured

## Managing Your Agent List

You can control which agents appear in your dropdown:

1. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the sidebar
2. Go to the **Agents** tab
3. Enable or disable agents using the checkboxes
4. Only enabled agents appear in your agent selector

See [Managing Available Agents](managing-available-agents.md) for more details.

## Choosing the Right Agent

### Match Agent to Task

| Task Type | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| Data analysis | Agents with code interpreter tools |
| Document questions | Agents with knowledge base access |
| Creative writing | General-purpose or creative agents |
| Technical support | Domain-specific technical agents |
| Image generation | Agents with DALL-E or image tools |

### Read Agent Descriptions

If available, agent descriptions help you understand:
- The agent's purpose and specialization
- Types of tasks it handles well
- Any limitations or specific use cases

### Try Different Agents

If one agent's response isn't what you need:
- Try the same question with a different agent
- Some agents may be better suited for your specific question
- Feedback through ratings helps administrators improve agent assignments

## Tips for Better Results

### Start Fresh When Switching

Since switching agents creates a new conversation:
- Restate your question clearly in the new conversation
- Don't assume the new agent knows what you discussed before
- Provide necessary context in your first message

### Use Agent Specializations

- Use specialized agents for their intended purpose
- General agents are versatile but may not have domain expertise
- Specialized agents often provide more accurate, detailed responses

### Ask About Capabilities

If you're unsure what an agent can do:
- Ask: "What can you help me with?"
- Ask: "What tools or data do you have access to?"
- The agent can describe its capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### No Agents in Dropdown

- Wait for agents to load (you may see a loading state)
- Refresh the page
- Check Settings > Agents to ensure agents are enabled
- Contact your administrator if no agents are available

### Agent Not Responding

- The selected agent may be experiencing issues
- Try selecting a different agent
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check for system status announcements

### Wrong Agent Selected

- Simply select the correct agent from the dropdown
- A new conversation will start with the correct agent
- Return to your previous conversation from the sidebar if needed

### Can't Find a Specific Agent

- Use Settings > Agents to see all available agents
- The agent may need to be enabled
- Search by name in the agent settings
- Contact your administrator if you need access to an agent

### Agent Keeps Creating New Conversations

This is expected behavior:
- Switching agents always starts a new conversation
- This maintains clean context for each agent
- Previous conversations are saved in the sidebar
