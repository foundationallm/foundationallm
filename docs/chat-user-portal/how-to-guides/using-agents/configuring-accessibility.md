# Configuring Accessibility Settings

Customize the Chat User Portal to meet your visual and notification preferences.

## Accessing Accessibility Settings

1. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar, next to your name
2. In the Settings dialog, click the **Accessibility** tab
3. Adjust settings as needed
4. Click **Close** when finished — changes are applied immediately

## Available Settings

### Auto-Hide Popup Notifications

Control whether notification messages (toasts) disappear automatically or stay visible until you dismiss them.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **On** (default) | Notifications fade away after a few seconds |
| **Off** | Notifications stay visible until you click to dismiss them |

**When to disable auto-hide:**
- If you need more time to read notifications
- If you use a screen reader and want notifications to remain accessible
- If you frequently miss important status messages

**How to change:**
1. Find the **Auto hide popup notifications** toggle
2. Click the toggle to switch between On and Off

### Text Size

Adjust the overall text size throughout the portal to improve readability.

| Size | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **80%** | Seeing more content on screen |
| **100%** (default) | Standard viewing |
| **150%** | Easier reading, larger text |

**How to change:**
1. Find the **Text size** slider
2. Drag the slider left to decrease or right to increase
3. The percentage displays next to the slider (e.g., "120%")
4. Text updates immediately as you adjust

> **Tip:** You can also use your browser's built-in zoom (`Ctrl +` / `Ctrl -` on Windows, `Cmd +` / `Cmd -` on Mac) for additional size adjustments.

### Display Recommendations

For the best experience:
- Use a screen resolution of at least 1280×720
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
- Position your monitor to reduce glare
- Take regular breaks when reading long conversations

## Mobile Accessibility

On mobile devices:
- Use your device's built-in accessibility features (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android)
- Enable larger text in your device's Display settings
- The interface automatically adjusts for smaller screens
- Touch targets are sized for easy tapping

## Troubleshooting

### Text Size Not Changing

1. Try refreshing the page (`F5` or `Ctrl + R`)
2. Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
3. Clear your browser cache and try again

### Screen Reader Not Reading Elements

1. Ensure your screen reader is in "forms mode" or "focus mode" when interacting with inputs
2. Try a different browser — Chrome and Firefox have the best screen reader support
3. Update your screen reader to the latest version

### Keyboard Focus Not Visible

1. Check your browser's accessibility settings for "Show focus indicators"
2. Some browser extensions can interfere with focus styles
3. Try disabling browser extensions temporarily

### Settings Not Saving

Accessibility settings are saved in your browser's session storage. They persist as long as:
- You stay logged in
- You don't clear browser data
- You use the same browser

If settings reset unexpectedly:
1. Check that cookies and site data aren't being blocked
2. Avoid using "private" or "incognito" mode for persistent settings
