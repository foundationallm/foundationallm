# My Agents

Learn how to view and manage the agents you own.

## Overview

The **My Agents** page displays agents where you have the **Owner** role. This is a filtered view that shows only agents you've created or been granted ownership of.

## Accessing My Agents

1. In the Management Portal sidebar, click **My Agents** under the **Agents** section
2. The table loads showing only agents you own

## Difference from All Agents

| View | Shows |
|------|-------|
| **All Agents** | All agents you have permission to view (based on Reader, Contributor, or Owner roles) |
| **My Agents** | Only agents where you have the Owner role |

Use **My Agents** when you want to focus on agents you're directly responsible for.

## Agent List Features

The My Agents view uses the same interface as All Agents:

### Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Agent name and display name (if set) |
| **Description** | Brief description of the agent's purpose |
| **Expiration Date** | Date when the agent becomes inactive (if set) |
| **Edit** | Modify agent configuration |
| **Delete** | Remove the agent |
| **Set Default** | Make this the default agent |

### Search and Filter

- Use the search box to filter by name or description
- Click column headers to sort
- Use pagination controls to navigate large lists

## Owner Capabilities

As an agent owner, you can:

- **Edit** all configuration settings
- **Delete** the agent
- **Set as Default** (if you also have User Access Administrator role)
- **Manage Access Control** - Add or remove role assignments for other users

## Checking Your Role

To verify your role for a specific agent:

1. Click the **Edit** icon for the agent
2. Look for the **Access Control** button in the top right
3. Open Access Control to see all role assignments

## Becoming an Owner

You become an agent owner when:

1. **You create the agent** - Creators automatically receive Owner role
2. **Ownership is assigned** - An existing owner or administrator grants you the Owner role
