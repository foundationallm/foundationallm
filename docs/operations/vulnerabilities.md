# Vulnerabilities: Identification, communication, and remediation

FoundationaLLM is committed to maintaining the security of our platform and protecting the integrity of your data. We conduct regular security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in our platform.

## **Vulnerability Identification:**

1. **Regular Red-Team Exercises:**
   - Our security protocols include routine red-team exercises aimed at identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within the Azure platform.
   - Through these exercises, we simulate real-world attack scenarios to proactively identify and address any weaknesses in our security posture.

2. **Regular Builds and Container Image Scans:**
   - To stay ahead of emerging threats, we conduct regular builds and scans of our container images.
   - This proactive approach involves identifying and addressing newly reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) promptly.
   - By integrating security scans into our regular build processes, we ensure that our container images adhere to the latest security standards and mitigate potential risks effectively.

## **Vulnerability Severity Categorization:**

Severity levels for vulnerabilities and other security findings are defined as follows:

1. **Minor:**
   - Vulnerabilities categorized as minor pose low or negligible risk to our system's security.
   - These issues typically have minimal impact on operations and can be addressed during routine maintenance.

2. **Major:**
   - Major vulnerabilities signify a moderate level of risk and may have a noticeable impact on security if left unaddressed.
   - Immediate attention is given to major vulnerabilities to mitigate potential security gaps and maintain a secure environment.

3. **High:**
   - Vulnerabilities classified as high represent a significant risk to the security and stability of our Azure platform.
   - Urgent action is taken to address high-severity issues, often involving immediate patches or remediation steps to minimize potential threats.

4. **Critical:**
   - Critical vulnerabilities pose a severe and imminent threat to the integrity and confidentiality of our system.
   - Immediate and comprehensive measures are implemented to address critical vulnerabilities, including rapid deployment of patches, configuration changes, or other necessary security controls.

This severity categorization allows us to prioritize our response efforts based on the potential impact and urgency associated with each vulnerability. Regular assessments and adjustments are made to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the severity levels assigned to vulnerabilities.

## **Communication of Patched Versions:**

We are committed to maintaining transparent and effective communication regarding security updates and patched versions. Our primary channel for disseminating information about patched versions is our official GitHub release page. This ensures that our users and stakeholders have immediate access to crucial details about the updates, including security enhancements and fixes.

Key points related to the communication of patched versions on our GitHub release page:

1. **Release Notifications:**
   - Timely notifications about new releases, including security patches, will be posted on our GitHub release page.
   - Users are encouraged to subscribe to release notifications to stay informed about the latest updates and security improvements.

2. **Detailed Release Notes:**
   - Each release on our GitHub page will include comprehensive release notes outlining the changes, enhancements, and specific security vulnerabilities addressed.
   - This transparent approach provides our community with detailed insights into the updates and the importance of applying the latest patches.

3. **Vulnerability Disclosure:**
   - We adhere to responsible disclosure practices by openly acknowledging and crediting the individuals or organizations that report security vulnerabilities to us.
   - Detailed information about the vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and the corresponding patches will be shared on our GitHub release page.

4. **Encouraging Regular Updates:**
   - Users are strongly encouraged to regularly check our GitHub release page for the latest updates and security patches.
   - Proactive adoption of the latest releases ensures that users benefit from the most recent security enhancements and protection against potential threats.

By leveraging our GitHub release page as a central hub for communication, we aim to streamline the process of disseminating critical information and empowering our user community to maintain a secure environment.
