# Guidance for creating release notes

Creating release notes is an essential part of the software development and release process. Release notes provide valuable information to end-users, stakeholders, and other team members about the changes, enhancements, and fixes introduced in a software release. Here's a structured process for creating release notes:

## 1. Define the release scope and content

- Understand the changes included in the release.
- Identify new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and any other significant changes.

## 2. Use a version control system

- Review the commit history and pull requests associated with the release.
- Identify the issues or features implemented during the release period.

## 3. Categorize changes

- Group changes into categories for clarity. Common categories include:
  - New Features
  - Enhancements
  - Bug Fixes
  - Deprecations
  - Security Updates

## 4. Collect information

- Gather details for each change, including:
  - Brief description of the change.
  - Associated issue or feature request numbers.
  - Names of contributors or teams involved.

## 5. Prioritize information

- Arrange the changes in order of importance or relevance to users.
- Highlight major features or critical bug fixes at the top.

## 6. Write Release Notes

- Craft concise and clear release notes.
- Use a consistent format and style.
- Include a header with the release version, date, and any important announcements.

## 7. Provide context

- Offer context for each change. Explain why a feature was added or why a bug fix was necessary.
- Include information that helps users understand the impact of the changes.

## 8. Include links

- Add links to relevant documentation, issue trackers, or pull requests for more details.
- This helps users and developers find additional information if needed.

## 9. Test Release Notes

- Review the release notes to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Verify that all changes are appropriately documented.

## 10. Review with stakeholders

- Share the draft release notes with relevant stakeholders, such as product managers, developers, and quality assurance teams.
- Incorporate feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## 11. Publish release notes

- We will publish release notes as part of creating a new release in github.
- If applicable, notify users through email, social media, or other communication channels.

## 12. Archive previous release notes

- Maintain a historical record by archiving previous release notes.  Relase notes for previous releases will remain visible with those releases in github.
- This helps users track changes over time and understand the evolution of the software.

## 13. Update documentation

- Ensure that other documentation, such as user guides or API documentation, is updated to reflect the changes introduced in the release.

## 14. Automate if possible

- Consider automating parts of the release notes generation process, especially if your project follows a structured development workflow with clear commit messages and pull request descriptions.

## 15. Seek user feedback

- Encourage users to provide feedback on the release notes. This can help you improve the clarity and usefulness of future release notes.

By following this process, you can create comprehensive and user-friendly release notes that effectively communicate the changes made in each software release.
