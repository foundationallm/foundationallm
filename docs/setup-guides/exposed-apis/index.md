# Exposed API Documentation

FoundationaLLM (FLLM) exposes two convenient API interfaces that enable developers and architects to directly interact with the FLLM platform for automation and integration tasks. This approach provides an alternative to using the provided user interfaces.

- [Core API:](core-api.md) The Core API supports direct completion requests against FLLM's agents.
- [Management API:](management-api.md) The Management API abstracts FLLM's configuration, enabling programmatic setup of agents, datasources, and prompts.
  - The [Management UI](../management-ui/management-ui.md) implements a frontend interface on top of the Management API, simplifying common agent configuration tasks
