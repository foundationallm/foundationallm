![Contrast](media/Contrast-AA-AAA.png)

AA and AAA are levels of color contrast for web pages that indicate how readable the text is: 
- `AA`: The minimum contrast ratio for normal text is 4.5:1, and 3:1 for large text. This level is considered a passing grade, but it might still be difficult for some users to read. 

- `AAA`: The contrast ratio for normal text is 7:1, and 4.5:1 for large text. This level is considered to create the most accessible content and best user experience. 
 
Color contrast is important for legibility, especially for users with color blindness or other conditions that make it difficult to differentiate between colors. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend these contrast ratios to help designers create readable interfaces. 
While Level AAA is recommended, it's not required for all sites. The best approach is to consider your organization, the purpose of your content, and your typical users.
