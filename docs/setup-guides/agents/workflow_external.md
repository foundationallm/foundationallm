## External Agent Workflow

> [!NOTE] 
> This is an advanced workflow that can be used to create an agent that has the power to utilize an external workflow developed fully in Python. These agents can be configured to use different models, prompts, and tools to provide customized responses to user requests.  Using an external workflow allows you to have full control over the logic and flow of the agent's responses, making it a powerful tool for advanced use cases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This type of workflow requires a good understanding of Python programming and the Langchain framework. It is recommended for advanced users who are comfortable with coding and have experience in developing custom workflows.

## When to use this workflow?

This workflow is useful when you want to you want to be in full control of the logic and flow of the agent's responses. This can be useful for complex tasks that require custom logic, calling outisde APIs or take adavantage of already deployed private Machine Learning models by your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Code examples showing how to create these workflows in Python will be added soon.
