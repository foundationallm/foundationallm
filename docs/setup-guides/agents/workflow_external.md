## External Agent Workflow

> [!NOTE] 
> This is an advanced workflow that can be used to create an agent that has the power to utilize an external workflow developed fully in Python. These agents can be configured to use different models, prompts, and tools to provide customized responses to user requests.  Using an external workflow allows you to have full control over the logic and flow of the agent's responses, making it a powerful tool for advanced use cases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This type of workflow requires a good understanding of Python programming and the Langchain framework. It is recommended for advanced users who are comfortable with coding and have experience in developing custom workflows.

## When to use this workflow?

This workflow allows full control over the agent's logic and responses, ideal for complex tasks needing custom logic, external API calls, or private Machine Learning models. It's also useful when you need precise control over tool routing, latency optimization, content generation, response formatting, or using a fixed structure with LLMs.

> [!NOTE]
> Code examples showing how to create these workflows in Python will be added soon.
