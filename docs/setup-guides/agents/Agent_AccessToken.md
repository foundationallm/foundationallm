# Agent Access Token

To allow the flexibility of using an agent without requiring the user to be authenticated using Entra ID credentials, you can create an **Agent Access Token**. This is particularly useful for public applications that want to provide access to the agent without requiring users to log in with their Entra ID credentials.

## Quick Start to creating and using an Agent Access Token

1. In the **Security** section of the agent configuration, click on the **Create Access Token** button to create a new access token.

13.	Under `completions`, expand `completion` and pick POST `Requests a completion with Agent Access Token`
14. Set the Authorization type to No Auth
