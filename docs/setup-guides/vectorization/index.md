# Vectorization

Foundationa**LLM** (FLLM) provides utilities and services to support vectorizing your data in batch and on-demand modalities. Vectorization is a multi-step proces, starting with loading your data, splitting (or chunking) the data as required, performing vector embeddings, and storing the vectors into a vector index so [an agent](../agents/index.md) can later retrieve relevant information through a vector search.
