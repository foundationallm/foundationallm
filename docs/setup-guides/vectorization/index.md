# Vectorization

This section describes the content vectorization concepts and how to configure vectorization in FoundationaLLM.

## Getting Started

- [Vectorization concepts](vectorization-concepts.md) - Understand how vectorization works
- [Configuring vectorization](vectorization-configuration.md) - Set up vectorization services

## Knowledge Sources

Configure various knowledge sources for vectorization:

- [SharePoint Online Guide](sharepoint-upload-guide.md) - Use SharePoint document libraries as a knowledge source
- [Azure Data Lake Guide](azure-data-lake-guide.md) - Use Azure Data Lake Storage as a knowledge source
- [Knowledge Graph Source](knowledge-graph-source.md) - Use Knowledge Graphs as a knowledge source

## Configuration & Operations

- [Managing vectorization profiles](vectorization-profiles.md) - Configure data sources, text partitioning, embeddings, and indexing
- [Triggering vectorization](vectorization-triggering.md) - Run vectorization manually or on schedule
- [Monitoring and troubleshooting](vectorization-monitoring-troubleshooting.md) - Debug vectorization issues

## Data Pipelines

For more advanced document processing scenarios, see:
