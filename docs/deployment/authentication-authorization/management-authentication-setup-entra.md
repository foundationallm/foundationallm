# Management API and portal authentication setup: Microsoft Entra ID

FoundationaLLM comes with out-of-the-box support for Microsoft Entra ID authentication. This means that you can use your Microsoft Entra ID account to log in to the management portal.

## Create the Microsoft Entra ID applications

To enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication for the Management API and portal, you need to create two applications in the Microsoft Azure portal:

- A client application that will be used by the management portal to authenticate users.
- An API application that will be used by the Management API to authenticate users.

### Pre-requisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be aware that after completing this registration and the other app registrations in Entra ID as instructed in the [docs](docs/deployment/authentication-authorization/index.md) you will complete the deployment steps outlined at [deploy the solution](../../deployment/deployment-starter.md) then you will be revisiting your app registrations to complete some of the settings that require the solution to be deployed before the entire app registration is completed successfully.

#### Setup App Configuration access

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as at least a Contributor.
2. Navigate to the Resource Group that was created as part of the deployment.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you performed an Azure Container Apps (ACA) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment, you will see an extra Resource Group that starts with `ME_` or `MC_` in addition to the Resource Group defined during the deployment. You will need to navigate to the Resource Group that **does not start with** `ME_` or `MC_` to access the App Configuration resource.
3. Select the **App Configuration** resource and select **Configuration explorer** to view the values. If you cannot access the configurations, add your user account as an **App Configuration Data Owner** through Access Control (IAM). You need this role in order to update the configurations as a required part of the authentication setup. To add your user account to the appropriate role, follow the instructions in the [Configure access control for services](../../deployment/configure-access-control-for-services.md#azure-app-configuration-service) document.

### Create the client application

#### Register the client application in the Microsoft Entra ID admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra ID admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least a Cloud Application Administrator.
2. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.

    ![The app registrations menu item in the left-hand menu is highlighted.](media/entra-app-registrations.png)

3. On the page that appears, select **+ New registration**.
4. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter a name for your application, such as *FoundationaLLM-ManagementClient*. You should indicate that this is for the management client application by appending *-ManagementClient* to the name.
5. Under **Supported account types**, select *Accounts in this organizational directory only*.
6. Select **Register**.

    ![The new client app registration form is displayed.](media/entra-register-management-client-app.png)

7. The application's **Overview** pane displays upon successful registration. Record the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** to add to your App Configuration settings later.

    ![The Entra app client ID and Directory ID values are highlighted in the Overview blade.](media/entra-management-client-app-overview.png)

#### Add a redirect URI to the client application

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
2. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**. In the pane that opens, select **Single-page application**. This is for the Vue.js management application.
3. Add a **Redirect URI** under Single-page application for your deployed Vue.js management application. Enter `<YOUR_MANAGEMENT_APP_URL>/signin-oidc`, replacing `<YOUR_MANAGEMENT_APP_URL>` with the management UI application URL. For example, it should look something like `https://d85a09ce067141d5807a.eastus.aksapp.io/signin-oidc` for an AKS deployment, or `https://fllmaca002managementuica.graybush-c554b849.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/signin-oidc` for an ACA deployment.
4. Add a **Redirect URI** under Single-page application for local development of the management portal Vue.js application: `http://localhost:3001/signin-oidc`.

    ![The Authentication left-hand menu item and redirect URIs are highlighted.](media/entra-app-management-client-authentication-uris.png)

<!-- 8. Under **Front-channel logout URL**, enter `<YOUR_CHAT_APP_URL>/signout-oidc`. -->

If you wish to [configure authentication in Postman](../../development/directly-calling-apis.md#postman-collection) for executing calls against the Core API, you will need to add a **Redirect URI** under **Mobile and desktop applications** for Postman. Enter `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback` for the URI. To do this, complete the following steps:

1. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**. In the pane that opens, select **Mobile and desktop applications**.
2. Enter `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback` for the **Custom redirect URIs** value.

    ![The Authentication left-hand menu item and redirect URIs are highlighted.](media/entra-app-client-authentication-uris-postman.png)
