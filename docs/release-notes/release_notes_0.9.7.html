<h2 id="whats-new">What's New</h2>
<p>This release introduces several major features that enhance the FoundationaLLM experience for end users:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>End User Agent Selection</strong>: An enhanced Settings dialog allows you to pick and choose which agents are displayed in your agent dropdown, giving you control over your agent list and enabling you to customize your workspace to show only the agents you use most frequently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Featured Agents in Chat Portal</strong>: A new &quot;Featured agents&quot; section in the agent dropdown enables highlighting new agents that users should try, making it easier to discover and explore new capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Model-Agnostic Agents with Agent Parity</strong>: The new Model Agnostic Agents enables agents and tools to use different models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) as best suited to each task. Three new agents have been built with agent parity in mind, ensuring consistent behavior across models. Capabilities not natively supported by one model are now enabled consistently for all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Pipelines</strong>: Data pipelines provide powerful capabilities for processing and indexing files across FoundationaLLM. In the front end, data pipelines automatically process end user file uploads, extracting content, generating embeddings, and making files searchable for your agents. On the backend, data pipelines handle files private to specific agents, ensuring secure and isolated processing. Additionally, data pipelines enable the ingestion and indexing of large document collections, making it possible to build comprehensive knowledge bases from thousands or millions of documents efficiently and at scale.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prompt Injection Detection for Knowledge Sources</strong>: If this shield is enabled for the data pipeline used by your agent, whenever you or a user upload a file, it will be automatically scanned for malicious prompt injections. If a prompt injection is detected, you will receive an error message and the file will not be uploaded, indexed, or available for subsequent conversations. This acts like an &quot;antivirus&quot; for knowledge sources, protecting your agents from malicious content embedded in files.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Code Interpreter Tool</strong>: The code interpreter has been significantly improved with structured data handling (automatic previews of pandas DataFrames), a protocol that guides LLM code generation to produce results of interest, and improved error handling that provides clear feedback to users (e.g., when images exceed available memory in the sandbox).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple File Uploads</strong>: You can now upload up to 10 documents at a time with a single request, making it faster and more convenient to share multiple files with your agent. Later, you can ask the agent to tell you what files are available in your conversation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Artifacts improvements</strong>: Improved artifact display and organization for better visibility into tool execution details make it easier to understand how the agent processed your request. For example, the code interpreter tool's Code artifact now makes it easier to read both the code that was generated and input to the tool, as well as the code that was actually executed by the tool</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-new-in-terms-of-agents">What's New in Terms of Agents</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model-Agnostic Agents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>FoundationaLLMFunctionCallingWorkflow</strong>: New workflow enabling agents and tools to use different models as best suited to the problem. This model-agnostic approach allows optimal model selection per task.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Parity</strong>: Three new agents have been built with agent parity in mind, ensuring that the behavior of an agent using GPT is similar to an agent built with Claude, which is similar to Gemini. This consistency provides a uniform experience regardless of the underlying model.</li>
<li><strong>Tool-Based Capability Enablement</strong>: Capabilities that might not be supported natively by one model are now enabled consistently for all through the agentic use of tools. Examples include file processing and generation, which work uniformly across all model types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Code Interpreter Tool Enhancements</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured data handling with previews</strong>: Automatic detection and handling of pandas DataFrames and Series. DataFrames are auto-saved to CSV with preview generation (first 10 rows) returned as structured metadata. Series are converted to dictionaries for serialization, making it easy to work with structured data in code execution results.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol for guiding LLM code generation</strong>: AST-based variable extraction from the last line of code (<code>_extract_last_variable_names</code> function) guides the LLM to structure code that returns results as variables in the last line. This protocol supports single variables, tuples, and assignments, enabling the LLM to generate code that produces results of interest more reliably.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced error handling and resilience</strong>: Comprehensive try-except blocks catch container crashes, timeouts, and memory limit errors. Error details are captured and provided to the agent for user communication (e.g., &quot;image exceeds available memory in sandbox&quot;). Errors within the code interpreter are conveyed to the agent for summary to the user, providing clear feedback on execution issues.</li>
<li><strong>File management improvements</strong>: Upload/download capabilities, automatic detection of newly generated files by comparing before/after file lists, comprehensive file metadata tracking including file object IDs, original file names, file paths, sizes, content types, and conversation IDs.</li>
<li><strong>Code preparation</strong>: Automatic markdown code block stripping via <code>__prepare_code</code> method ensures clean code execution.</li>
<li><strong>Session management</strong>: Persistent code sessions with dynamic session IDs from runnable_config, enabling stateful code execution across multiple tool invocations.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive artifact generation</strong>: Detailed metadata including original prompts, generated code, tool output, errors, and results, enabling full traceability of code execution.</li>
<li><strong>Token usage tracking</strong>: Input/output token tracking for monitoring and cost analysis across code generation and execution.</li>
</ul>
