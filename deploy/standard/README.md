# Standard Deployment with AKS

Compared to the quick start deployment using Azure Container Apps (ACA), the Foundationa**LLM** Standard Deployment with AKS is tailored for scaling up to production environments. It leverages Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for robust scalability and management, requiring an Azure Subscription with Azure OpenAI access.

Please follow the official documentation to [deploy a Standard environment](https://docs.foundationallm.ai/deployment/deployment-standard.html).
