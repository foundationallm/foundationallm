We are happy to accept contributions to the FoundationaLLM project in the form of [feedback](https://foundationallm.ai/contact), [bug reports/feature requests](https://github.com/solliancenet/foundationallm/issues/new/choose), and [pull requests](https://github.com/solliancenet/foundationallm/pulls). If you want to make code contributions, please be sure to branch from the head of the default branch.

## Development approach

Are you interested in contributing to the code? We would love your help! However, we do have some guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can keep things running smoothly.

Please review the [development approach](./docs/development/development-approach.md) document.

## Submitting issues

Please keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not meant as a general support forum but for reporting non-security bugs and feature requests. If you do find yourself in need of general support, please review support options and contact us through the [FoundationaLLM website](https://foundationallm.ai/contact).

For security-related issues, please view our [Security Policy](https://github.com/solliancenet/foundationallm/security/policy).

When submitting an issue for a bug, please search to see if an issue already exists for the bug you encountered ([FoundationaLLM/issues](https://github.com/solliancenet/foundationallm/issues)). If you find an existing issue that describes your bug, please comment and add any additional details you can offer, including relevant library versions and other useful environment details.

Do you have an idea for a feature or a general question about something not covered in the documentation, select one of the appropriate [issue templates](https://github.com/solliancenet/foundationallm/issues/new/choose) and provide as much detail as possible.
