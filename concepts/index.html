<h2 id="authorization">Authorization</h2>
<h3 id="secret-key">Secret Key</h3>
<p>A secret key is a unique string that is used to authenticate an agent to the FoundationaLLM platform. The secret key is generated by the FoundationaLLM platform and is used to sign requests made by the agent.</p>
<h3 id="role-based-access-control">Role Based Access Control</h3>
<p>Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting access to resources based on the roles of users. In RBAC, roles are created and assigned to users, and permissions are assigned to roles.</p>
<h3 id="policy-based-access-control">Policy Based Access Control</h3>
<p>Policy-based access control (PBAC) is a method of restricting access to resources based on policies. In PBAC, policies are created and assigned to users, and permissions are assigned to policies.</p>
<h3 id="security-principal">Security Principal</h3>
<p>A security principal is an entity that can be authenticated and authorized to access resources. Examples of security principals include users, groups, and service identities.</p>
<h4 id="virtual-security-principal">Virtual Security Principal</h4>
<p>A virtual security principal is a security principal that is created dynamically by the FoundationaLLM platform. Virtual security principals are used to represent agents and other entities that do not have a direct mapping to a user or group.</p>
<h5 id="virtual-user">Virtual User</h5>
<p>A virtual user is a virtual security principal that represents an agent access token. Virtual users are created by the FoundationaLLM platform and are used to authenticate agents via agent access tokens.</p>
<h5 id="virtual-security-group">Virtual Security Group</h5>
<p>A virtual security group is a virtual security principal that represents the group of agent access tokens created for a user. Virtual security groups are created by the FoundationaLLM platform and are used to manage access control for agents via agent access tokens.</p>
<h2 id="agent">Agent</h2>
<h3 id="agent-workflow">Agent Workflow</h3>
<p>An agent workflow drives the core interactions of an agent with its associated tools. It can range from a simple call to an LLM that has function calling capabilities to a complex flow like the LangChain React Agent or an Open AI Assistant.</p>
<h3 id="agent-tool">Agent Tool</h3>
<p>An agent tool is a tool that is associated with an agent. Agent tools can be used to perform various tasks, such as executing code, interacting with APIs, or processing data.</p>
<h3 id="agent-access-token">Agent Access Token</h3>
<p>An agent access token is a unique string that is used to authenticate an agent to the FoundationaLLM platform. The agent access token is generated by the FoundationaLLM platform and is used to create a virtual user.</p>
<h4 id="agent-access-token-virtual-user">Agent Access Token Virtual User</h4>
<p>An agent access token virtual user is a virtual user that represents an agent access token. Agent access token virtual users are created by the FoundationaLLM platform and are used to authenticate agents via agent access tokens.</p>
<h3 id="agent-virtual-security-group">Agent Virtual Security Group</h3>
<p>An agent virtual security group is a virtual security group that represents the group of agent access tokens created for an agent. Agent virtual security groups are created by the FoundationaLLM platform and are used to manage access control for agents via agent access tokens.</p>
<h2 id="chargeback">Chargeback</h2>
<p>Chargeback is a mechanism for tracking and billing the usage of resources by agents, users, or other entities that can be associated with cost centers. Chargeback allows organizations to allocate costs based on the actual usage of resources by cost center-enabled entities.</p>
<h2 id="data-pipeline">Data Pipeline</h2>
<p>A FoundationaLLM data pipeline defines a process that aims to extract data from a data source, transform it to make it suitable for LLM-based workloads (e.g., extracting text, partitioning text, extracting entities and relationships, embedding text, creating knowledge graphs, etc.), and load it into a target system (e.g., vector store, knowledge store, etc.). Data pipelines can be managed using the FoundationaLLM Management Portal (interactively) or the FoundationaLLM Management API (programmatically).</p>
<p>FoundationaLLM data pipelines are built from the ground up to address the following key requirements for enterprise-grade Generative AI workloads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> - handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally to meet the demands of enterprise workloads. FoundationaLLM data pipelines are designed to handle anything from a few documents or records to millions of documents or records.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - have a flexible and modular structure that is suitable from complex processing, parallelization of work, scalability, and reusability of components.</li>
<li><strong>Local and Global Processing</strong> - support local processing of data (e.g., text extraction, text partitioning, entity extraction, relationship extraction, etc.) and global processing of data (e.g., assembly of knowledge graphs).</li>
<li><strong>Parameterization</strong> - allow the configuration of data pipelines using parameters that can be set at runtime. This avoids the need to create multiple data pipelines for different configurations (e.g., a single data pipeline definition can be used to handle all user file uploads in the User Portal).</li>
<li><strong>Extensiblity</strong> - enable the addition of new data pipeline stages and the modification of existing data pipeline stages to meet the specific requirements of different use cases. All data pipeline components are implemented using plugins.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see <a href="data-pipeline/data-pipeline.html">Data Pipelines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plugin">Plugin</h2>
<p>A plugin is a software component that can be used to extend the functionality of the FoundationaLLM platform. Plugins can be used to add new features, integrate with external systems, or perform other tasks. Plugins can be managed using the FoundationaLLM Management Portal (interactively) or the FoundationaLLM Management API (programmatically).</p>
<h3 id="plugin-package">Plugin Package</h3>
<p>A FoundationaLLM plugin package is a unit of versioning and deployment of one or more plugins. The Management Portal and Management API allow you to manage plugin packages. The following types of plugin packages are supported by the FoundationaLLM platform:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>
<p>A FoundationaLLM prompt is a text template that is used to create completion requests for agents. FoundationaLLM agents use prompts in two main contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agent Workflow</strong> - Prompts are used to create completion requests that identify which tools should be invoked and how the responses from the tools should be processed.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Tool</strong> - Prompts are used to contribute with additional context to the agent workflow (e.g., helping the workflow to understand the capabilities of the tool), or to provide instructions on the tools internal logic (e.g., to generate code that will be executed by the tool or to finalize the response of the tool).</li>
</ul>
<p>Prompts have support for variables, which allows them to be dynamically generated based on the context of the completion request. This makes prompts flexible and adaptable to different scenarios. For more details, see <a href="prompt/prompt-variable.html">Prompt variable</a>.</p>
<h2 id="quota">Quota</h2>
<p>A FoundationaLLM quota is a set of rules that define the limits on the usage of resources by a client. Quota definitions are used to enforce limits on the usage of resources by clients and to prevent abuse of the FoundationaLLM platform.</p>
<p>Each quota is enforced on a specific metric, such as the number of API completion calls or the number of agent completion calls. The following quota metrics are supported by the FoundationaLLM platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>API requests (quota enforces an API request rate limit).</li>
<li>Agent completion requests (quota enforces an agent completion request rate limit).</li>
</ul>
<p>Quota metric limits can be enforced globally or using specific partitioning mechanisms. The following quota metric partitioning mechanisms are supported by the FoundationaLLM platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>None (no partitioning, limit is enforced globally).</li>
<li>User identifier (limit is enforced per user unique identifier).</li>
<li>User principal name (limit is enforced per user principal name).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of FoundationaLLM quotas:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 requests per minute for API requests sent to the the <code>Completions</code> endpoint of Core API.</li>
<li>50 requests per minute per user principal name for API requests sent to the the <code>Completions</code> endpoint of Core API.</li>
<li>1000 agent completions requests per quarter hour per user identifier for agent completion requests sent to the Core API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quota-definition">Quota Definition</h3>
<p>FoundationaLLM quotas are specified using quota definitions. A quota definition is a JSON object that defines the limits on the usage of resources by a client. Quota definitions are stored in the main FoundationaLLM storage account, in the <code>quota</code> container in a file named <code>quota-store.json</code>.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="quota/quota-definition.html">Quota Definition</a>.</p>
<h3 id="api-raw-request-rate">API Raw Request Rate</h3>
<p>The API raw request rate is the maximum number of API requests that a client can make to a FoundationaLLM API within a specified time period.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="quota/api-raw-request-rate.html">API Raw Request Rate</a>.</p>
<h3 id="agent-request-rate">Agent Request Rate</h3>
<p>The API call rate is the maximum number of Core API completion calls that a client can make to the Core API targeting a specific agent within a specified time period. The API call rate is used to limit the rate at which a client can perform completions targeting a specific agent.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="quota/agent-request-rate.html">Agent Request Rate</a>.</p>
<h2 id="resource-provider">Resource Provider</h2>
<p>A resource provider is a platform component that is responsible for managing resources in the FoundationaLLM platform. Resource providers are used to create, update, delete, and retrieve resources such as agents, prompts, data sources, data pipelines, plugins and many more. All resource types available in the FoundationaLLM platform are managed by resource providers. The following resource providers are supported by the FoundationaLLM platform:</p>
